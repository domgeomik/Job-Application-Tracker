Project Description:
The "Job Application Tracker" is a web application designed to help job seekers keep track of their job applications. Users can input job listings, record application details (e.g., status, date applied, company, contact person), and set reminders for follow-ups. This tool can help users stay organized during a job search, manage multiple applications, and track the progress of their job hunt.
