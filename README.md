Job Application Tracker

A Job Application Tracker is a tool or system designed to help individuals organize and manage their job search process.
It allows users to track details such as job titles, company names, application dates, job descriptions, the status of each application (e.g., applied, interview scheduled, rejected),
and any follow-up actions needed. By keeping all this information in one place, users can stay organized, maintain a clear overview of their progress,
and avoid missing important deadlines or follow-up opportunities.
