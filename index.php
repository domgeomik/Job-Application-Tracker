		 <h1>Job Application Tracker</h1>
        <p>A Job Application Tracker is a tool or system designed to help individuals organize and manage their job search process efficiently. It allows users to track multiple aspects of their job applications in one central location. Typically, a job application tracker includes features such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span>Job Title & Company Name:</span> Track where and for which role you have applied.</li>
            <li><span>Application Status:</span> Monitor each stage of the application process (e.g., Applied, Interviewing, Offer, Rejected).</li>
            <li><span>Dates:</span> Record important dates like when the application was submitted, follow-up reminders, and interview dates.</li>
            <li><span>Contact Information:</span> Store recruiter or hiring manager contact details.</li>
            <li><span>Notes:</span> Add additional notes about the job or application process (e.g., feedback from interviews, preparation notes).</li>
            <li><span>Documents:</span> Keep track of the resume and cover letter versions used for specific applications.</li>
            <li><span>Follow-Up Reminders:</span> Set reminders to check in with companies or recruiters after a certain period of time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A job application tracker helps job seekers stay organized, maintain a clear overview of where they are in the hiring process for each role, and ensures no opportunity slips through the cracks during the job search process. This can be managed via spreadsheets, dedicated apps, or software platforms designed specifically for job tracking.</p>
